		  "text": "Financial technology, or “fintech” PR, creates awareness and third-party validation for fintech companies so they are not only more visible to C-Suite and other senior executives—but more trusted among them. With increased visibility and validation among key decision makers, fintech companies are more likely to sell their services into their target audiences – such as banks, finance companies, insurers or other fintechs.

	Fintech is an exceptionally crowded market, with over 30,000 companies vying for the same audiences (and budgets). Fintech PR builds business and product awareness and elevates brands this competitive landscape.

	Fintech PR turns brands into market leaders in influential news outlets, on air, and in everyday conversations in the boardroom and beyond."

		  "text": "A successful fintech PR campaign should result in a company outpacing direct competitors in the media and influencing sales cycles with decisions makers and C-suite executives at Banks, Lenders, Financial Institutions. Fintech PR campaigns should raise brand awareness, create new deals, and ultimately, increase revenue.

	In order to do this, fintech PR campaigns must be directly linked to marketing and higher level corporate goals.

	Fintech PR campaigns should not only inform the messaging and position of a company in the media, but also of other marketing and sales channels within the fintech company. Fintech PR campaigns should also introduce a fintech company’s unique philosophy to the market. It’s this philosophy that will extend the value of working with a company beyond the product itself.

	From a day-to-day perspective, a fintech PR agency should plan to capitalize on timely “news moments” in the fintech industry and create a calendar of corporate news announcements and thought leadership initiatives that align with key messages that the fintech company wants to put out the market. 

	Creating an impactful fintech PR campaign requires a deep understanding of the fintech industry-- as well as the larger finance, business and technology landscapes-- to understand what is already being said in the market (and what is not). This will directly influence how your company can differentiate its offerings from the rest of the market, and position your executives as opinion leaders in the space.

		  "text": "Fintech PR should guide companies’ messaging and positioning to elevate their brand and product above competitors and make them stand out in a crowded industry.

	Fintech has attracted over 30,000 VC funded startups, due in large part to the opportunities available to revolutionize the financial industry’s legacy banks, lenders, insurers and other financial institutions. This has created an extremely crowded space and intense competition between product offerings.

	While companies entering the market might have superior products to the existing competition, their messaging and positioning in the market can sometimes be exactly the same as competitors. This causes all marketing channels to be less effective.

	Fintech PR leverages your company’s work—even if it takes place in the ‘back office’ that rarely makes it into the spotlight—and communicates it in a way that is understandable and impactful to your target audience. It’s this work that will make your company stand out above the noise.
