	  "@type": "Answer",
	  "text": "Retail Technology companies need PR because the retail technology market is incredibly competitive.
Retail Technology companies normally have a handful of very well funded competitors or are going up against enterprise companies which in comparison have almost endless resources. 

Retail Technology PR allows companies to get noticed, take credit for their innovation and attract retailers using the third party credibility that PR offers. 

Companies in their growth phase need to create credibility extremely quickly in order to reach a critical mass of clients before competitors beat them to it. PR is only one  marketing channel and should be used in conjunction with other marketing channels to create an integrated campaign."
